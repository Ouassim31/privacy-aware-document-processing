# Privacy-Aware Document Processing

## Introduction

This application is intended to be used in apartment application procedures where documents need to be verified. It allows a landlord to process (verify) a document provided by an applicant in a privacy-preserving way.
The processing task is handled remotely by the **Payslip Analysis DApp** that is available on the [iExec marketplace](https://iex.ec/marketplace/). This application offers a generic interface that can easily be adapted by integrating your own DApps with custom document processing capabilities.

## Example Use Case

Imagine a setting where a landlord wants to rent out an apartment and make sure that the candidate applying for the apartment makes enough money to cover the monthly rent. In a traditional setting, the landlord would ask the applicant to hand in a payslip and check the applicant's income manually. This procedure is not privacy-perserving as a lot of sensitive personal information is exposed on the payslip that is not relevant for the rental. To solve this problem the landlord can make use of the [Payslip Analysis DApp](iexec-apps/payslip-analysis-tee) which will analyze the applicant's payslip document and then output a response to the question *"is the applicant's income sufficient to cover the rent"*. 

## Payslip Analysis DApp
The [Payslip Analysis DApp](iexec-apps/payslip-analysis-tee/app/src/app.py) was developed to demonstrate the architecture.
It is limited to only accept text based PDF documents. It uses a simple algorithm to search for the keywords 
`[nettoentgelt, Ã¼berweisung, income]` in the extracted text. If a keyword is found and a floating point number is written horizontally to the
right of the word, it takes this number as the income and verifies if it is larger than three times the monthly rent.

The limitation of this approach is that the income value has to be located horizontally to the right
side of the corresponding keyword on the PDF file. Payslips that use another format are currently not 
supported in the implementation.

This [dummy payslip](iexec-apps/payslip-analysis-tee/dataset/datasets/original/dummy-payslip.pdf) follows the requirement and can be used to test the architecture.

## Prerequisites

Make sure to install the [Metamask browser extension](https://metamask.io/) and to create an ethereum wallet. This will be needed to sign transactions. Then, go to the [iExec marketplace](https://iex.ec/marketplace/), log in with MetaMask
and allow the site to add a network to your MetaMask account. Now, switch the network. This way, you can run the application on iExec's sidechain Bellecour, which is free of charge.

Also, a **Google account** is required to login.

## Getting Started

1. Start the [backend & database](Backend/README.md)
2. Start the [frontend](Frontend/README.md)
3. Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to access the web interface

## Usage

If you are requesting a document from an applicant that you would like to process

1. Go to the Landlord section (this section gives you an overview of all of your requests)
2. Create a *new request*
3. Send the generated Request-ID to the applicant and wait until the applicant has uploaded a document
4. Once the document was uploaded you can execute the task
5. Once the task is completed you can download the result
6. You will be prompted to sign and pay for the transaction via MetaMask

If you have been invited to provide a document

1. Go to the Applicant section
2. Click on the *Upload Document* button
